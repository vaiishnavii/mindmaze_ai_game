# 🧠 MindMaze: Racing an AI to Beat the Maze

In my pursuit of exploring how AI can enhance interactive learning experiences, I recently built **MindMaze** — a grid-based game where you race against an AI agent trained to solve mazes optimally. Inspired by Field Day Lab’s mission to blend design, data, and play, I wanted to create something that could teach, adapt, and engage.

## 🎮 The Game

**MindMaze** is a simple maze runner — with a twist. Instead of just escaping a maze, you’re racing a red-dot AI rival that already knows the optimal path. It’s you vs. the machine.

### Key Features:
- 🔄 **Dynamic Difficulty:** Choose between Easy (5x5), Medium (10x10), and Hard (15x15) grids.
- 🧠 **A* Pathfinding AI:** The AI calculates and follows the shortest path using the A* algorithm.
- 🔴 **Ghost Race Mode:** Watch the AI move in real-time as you navigate.
- 💬 **Hints:** Get contextual hints based on AI’s optimal path.
- 📊 **End Summary:** Compare your path length and time with the AI and see your efficiency score.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

MindMaze is built using:
- JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- A* pathfinding for AI decision-making
- DOM events and intervals for live player-AI interaction

No external libraries were used — it's lightweight, fast, and easy to extend.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Implementing A* from scratch gave me a deeper understanding of heuristics and cost functions.
- Designing UI to reflect performance helped me think like an educator — not just a dev.
- Making the AI adaptive taught me how subtle tweaks (like hint timing) can impact engagement.

## 💡 Next Steps

I plan to expand MindMaze by:
- Tracking player clickstream data
- Generating procedurally complex mazes
- Adding analytics for learning behavior
